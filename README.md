# 🧠 MLFQ Scheduler Implementation
This project implements a Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) CPU scheduler using C and pthreads, simulating realistic scheduling scenarios across four different queues.

## 🧾 Overview
The MLFQ scheduler consists of four levels:

1. Q0 – Round Robin (RR) with 5ms time quantum

2. Q1 – First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), 5ms time allocation

3. Q2 – Priority Scheduling (priority = inverse of remaining time), 5ms allocation

4. Q3 – Shortest Job First (SJF), 5ms allocation

Processes move between these queues depending on their execution status. Unfinished processes are cycled back to Q0.

## ✨ Features
✅ Support for both default and custom process configurations

🧵 Thread-safe implementation using pthreads

📊 Detailed scheduling visualization and logging

📈 Calculates individual and average turnaround times

## ⚙️ Requirements
● Linux/Unix system

● GCC compiler

● pthread library

## 🛠️ Compilation
To compile the program, run:

gcc mlfq.c -o mlfq -lpthread

## ▶️ Usage
Run the compiled executable:

./mlfq

You will be prompted to choose:

1. Default processes:

  ● A: 300ms

  ● B: 150ms

  ● C: 250ms

  ● D: 350ms

  ● E: 450ms

2. Custom processes:

➥Specify number of processes (1–10)

➥For each process:

   ● Single-character ID

   ● Total CPU time required (in ms)

## 📋 Sample Output (Default Configuration)

======= Final Results =======

Process    Total Time    Turnaround Time

A          300           1290

B          150            730

C          250           1135

D          350           1395

E          450           1500

Average Turnaround Time: 1210.00

## 🔍 Implementation Details

● Simulates CPU execution using usleep()

● Thread-safe queues with mutex locks

● Tracks state transitions across queues

● Displays detailed scheduling steps and queue transitions

## 🧹 Cleanup
● Automatic cleanup of memory and mutexes after execution

## 📝 Notes
● Output may be verbose — ideal for understanding scheduling behavior

● For accurate results, run on a system with minimal background processes

● Default config should yield an average turnaround time of ~1210ms
